                <p><strong>Write Some Notes</strong> is a fun game based on magnetic refrigerator poetry where the only objectives are to explore and share your creativity!</p>
                <p>After creating a profile, you can choose either the <strong>Daily Prompt</strong>, which is the same for all players on a given day, or a <strong>Random Prompt</strong>. You are then given 60 random words or word modifier tiles.</p>
                <p>Move up to 25 word tiles from the word collection to your blank card to create your funniest, most creative response to the prompt. Then click <strong>Save</strong>!  Play again to your heart’s content!</p>
                <p>In the gallery within your profile, you can view all the prompts and responses you’ve ever made (as well as <strong>Delete</strong> any stinkers). You can also click on any prompt to see what creative responses other players have given to that response with their own collection of random words.</p>
                <p>More features are always being planned -- just ask me what I've got in the works!</p>
